Building the software

./do-update-makerpm.sh -S ${PWD} -w ${PWD}/tmp

To build the CUDA version

./do-update-makerpm.sh -G -S ${PWD} -w ${PWD}/tmp

Before running the CUDA builds, make sure the CUDA packages are installed
on your machine. Also export the appropriate UDA directories for a given distro:

RHEL 8.1

export NVIDIA_GPU_DIRECT=${NVIDIA_GPU_DIRECT:-/usr/src/nvidia-460.32.03}

Make sure you clear out the tmp directory before rebuilding

Once the SRC RPM is created, build the binary RPM from ./tmp/rpmbuild directory execute the following command

rpmbuild --rebuild --define "_topdir $(pwd)" --nodeps SRPMS/*.src.rpm
