Building the software

Software can be built either as RPM or DEB package. Two building scripts are provided:
./do-update-makerpm.sh and ./do-update-makedeb.sh which build RPM and DEB packages respectively

Please refer README for RPM build instructions

To build CPU-only package
	1. rm -rf <BUILD_DIR>
	2. ./do-update-makedeb.sh -S <SRC_DIR> -w <BUILD_DIR>
	Example:
		rm -rf ${PWD}/tmp; ./do-update-makedeb.sh -S ${PWD} -w ${PWD}/tmp

DEB build output contains both source and binary packages.
