 * Our goal is to allocate shared resources, but all processes are equal peers.
 * So we use a get_alloc approach where processes attempt to get a resource
 * reference (lookup and get) and if it's not on the list, it is allocated and
 * added.  This is used for rv_job_dev, rv_listener and rv_conn.
 * Each such list is protected by a mutex to prevent duplicate additions
 * and an RCU for actual list access.  The mutex also protects
 * get_alloc/list_del races.  All get_alloc calls are in premptable
 * app ioctl call context.
 * rv_listener list is rarely searched, so it simply uses a mutex and spinlock.

/*
 * When working with IB CM, Async events and timeouts we can't predict if and
 * when their callbacks will occur so they can't have a reference held in
 * advance. This presents opportunities for the callback to race with rv_conn
 * destruction. To solve this problem, we use rv_conn_get_check to get a
 * reference to rv_conn only if rv_conn.kref != 0. rv_conn and rv_sconn
 * destruction uses destroy_cm_id and del_timer_sync to stop all callbacks (and
 * allow any outstanding handlers to finish) before it proceeds to free rv_conn.
 * This ensures the cm_id, etc can remain valid enough for the callback to
 * call rv_conn_get_check and decide whether to simply ignore the event.
 * It also allows the rv_sconn to be the ib_cm, CQ, QP and timer context and
 * avoid searches. Once the callback has the reference, it is protected
 * from other threads calling rv_conn_release.

 * recovery, conn_timer is running for reconnect_timeout and once it fires,
 * the connect recovery is aborted and moved to ERROR
 *
 * If WAS_CONNECTED, post write in wrong state returns EAGAIN instead of EINVAL
 *
 * A complication is identifying when a connection is down for a receiving
 * end of a traffic pattern.  The receiver may see no packets and can't tell
 * a path down from an idle QP.  To address this periodic RDMA Write zero
 * can be sent if no traffic has been sent or received for a while.  This
 * situation is no worse that user space UD PSM as the job failure may
 * occur over an out of band network to kill the job.  A gap is the client side
 * of a connection desiring recovery, which requires the heatbeat to recognize.
 *
 * If the receiver happens to also be the server side of rv_sconn, we may
 * get a REQ while in connected because the sender may get a QP timeout
 * long before the receiver heartbeat notices.  We treat this as disconnect
 * and if appropriate (likely) begin connection recovery.

/*
 * Resources shared among all rv_user's using a given NIC port within a job
 * for a given kuid.  On the wire we use uid to limit jobs to a single user.
 * This approach has similarities to the hfi1 and Omni-Path jkey concept
 * but we are not restricted to the 16b HW jkey field here, so we use all
 * 32b of uid on the wire.
 *
 * There will typically be 1-8 NICs per node and 1-2 concurrent jobs
 * with one rv_user per CPU core per NIC.
 *
 * kref tracks total jdev references while user_count is the subset of
 * references representing attached rv_user objects.  To get_alloc a jdev
 * we must successfully get both.  In general user_count <= kref except
 * in the middle of rv_jdev_get_alloc.
 * Once jdev.user_count == 0 or kref == 0, the jdev is destined to destruction
 * and will not be returned in subsequent searches for attach or REQ processing.
 * This only happens when a new job starts as the previous job is cleaning up
 * and is not using a unique job key.  Such cases are rare.  By decoupling the
 * jobs with different jdev's the new job may also have different attach params.
 *
 * These fields are immutable and can be accessed without a lock:
 *	kuid, uid, dev, pd, dev_name, port_num,
 *	num_conn - number of rv_sconn per rv_conn
 *	index_bits - number of high bits of RDMA immed data to hold rv index
 *	loc_gid_index - SGID - only used on client rv_sconn
 *	loc_addr - abstraction of address compared with rem_addr to select
 *		client/server mode for each rv_sconn at conn_create time.
 *	log_gid - SGID - to double check loc_gid_index still is same GID
 *	service_id, q_depth
 *	qp_depth - max send and recv WQEs to use (N/A space for drain)
 *	reconnect_timeout (seconds), hb_interval (milliseconds),
 *	sgid_attr - local NIC gid & address for use by resolver
 *	max_users - 1<<index_bits
 *	hb_mr - MR for send/recv of heartbeat RDMA
 *
 * job_dev_entry, rcu - entry on rv_job_dev_list
 * conn_list - list of shared rv_conn, protected by RCU and conn_list_mutex
 *	conn_list_mutex prevents duplicate add in get_alloc
 * listener - created and shared when 1st server rv_conn is added
 * user_array[max_users] - rv_users sharing this jdev. user_array_lock protects
 *	rv_user.index - subscript to this array for given rv_user so
 *		RDMA recv immediate data can simply index to find which
 *		rv_user to deliver the completion to.
 *	user_array_next - where to start next search for free slot
